This is my file. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My file is my best friend. It is my life.

Without me, my file is useless. Without my file, I am useless. I must type in my file true. I must type straighter than my enemy who is trying to beat my wpm. I must outtype him before he outtypes me. I will...

My file and I know that what counts in c++ is not the characters we type, the noise of our keys, nor the smoke our CPU's make. We know that it is the wpm that counts. We will type...

My file is human, even as I [am human], because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its extensions, its syntax, its path, and its word count. I will keep my file opened and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before Bill Gates, I swear this creed. My file and I are defenders of the keyboard. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is encoded and there is no enemy, but peace!
